      <h1>Terms List:</h1>
      <p><strong>Browser</strong> - Browser refers to the program a website visitor is using to view the web  site. Examples include Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and  Internet Explorer.</p>
      <p><strong>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets</strong> - Also referred to simply as CSS, Cascading Style Sheets are used to  define the look and feel of a web site outside of the actual HTML  file(s) of the site. In recent years, CSS has replaced tables and other  HTML-based methods for formatting and laying out websites. The benefits  to using CSS are many, but some of the most important are the  simplification of a site&rsquo;s HTML files (which can actually increase  search engine rankings) and the ability to completely change the style  of a site by changing just one file, without having to make changes to  content.</p>
      <p><strong>Domain Name</strong> - The domain is the name by which a website is identified. The domain is  associated with an IP address. Domains can be purchased with any  combination of letters, hyphens (-), and numbers (though it can&rsquo;t start  with a hyphen). Depending on the extension (.com, .net, .org, etc.), a  domain can be anywhere up to 26 to 63 characters long.</p>
      <p><strong>FTP </strong>- FTP is an acronym for File Transfer Protocol.  As the name suggests, FTP is used to transfer files between computers on a network.  You can use FTP to exchange files between computer accounts, transfer files between an account and a desktop computer, or access online software archives. Keep in mind, however, that many FTP sites are heavily used and require several attempts before connecting.</p>
      <p><strong>HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language</strong> - Hypertext is any computer-based text that includes hyperlinks. Hypertext  can also include presentation devices like tables or images, in  addition to plain text and links.</p>
      <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> - is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.</p>
      <p><strong>RSS</strong> or <strong>Really Simple Syndication</strong> - RSS is a standardized <i>XML</i> format that allows  content to be syndicated from one site to another. It&rsquo;s  most commonly  used on blogs. RSS also allows visitors to subscribe to a blog or other  site and receive updates via a feed reader.</p>
      <p><strong>Server</strong> - the main computer in a network which provides files and services that are used by the other computers.</p>
      <p><strong>URL (or URI)</strong> - Stands for <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em>. A site&rsquo;s URL is its address, the  item that specifies where on the Internet it can the found.</p>
